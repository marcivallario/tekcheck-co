# TrekCheck

TrekCheck is an app for tracking trip lodging, transportation, & accommodation arrangements and storing traveler profiles.

## Motivation
The inspiration for TrekCheck came when working as a travel coordinator in film & television. The pure amount of data was overwhelming and all was tracked via a giant Google Sheet—-I cataloged features for an app I could build that would separate and handle this data to only serve me what I needed.
